#the "mid" argument specifies which region the CNV analysis should be performed on.
#e.g. for the CFH region this should be --mid 1:196.62mb:196.97mb

#the "baseDir" argument specifies where the input data is located

#the "include" argument specifies which data sources to include in the analysis
#by default both data sources (RD & RP) are included.

#the "plot" argument specifies whether to produce plots of
#the underlying data along with the segmentation
#to enable plotting set "plot" to 1
#if plot is set to 0, no plots will be created and the process will be faster

#the "weightedInsert" argument specifies whether to weight the probability of 
#the RP distance by the RP count which is especially useful for lower coverage data

#the "numIt" argument defines the number of training iterations, which is set to
#5 here but should be increased if analyzing many samples simultaneously
